All the codes can run from terminal as is mentioned in the assignment

Note while running gen_structure.py
- I have commented out plotting functions in this file to generate the outputs on console fastly.
- Whenever required, just uncomment those function calls.
------------------- Commands -------------------
- python gen_structure.py networks/random.elist
- python gen_structure.py networks/smallworld.elist
- python gen_structure.py subgraphs/facebook.elist
- python gen_structure.py subgraphs/twitter.elist

Note while running gen_centrality.py
- All the subgraphs except that of twitter ran within 10 minutes
- Twitter subgraph was not able to run on my laptop. It was stuck for more than 1 hours before my system crashed.
- After implementing standard algorithms too, closeness centrality was coming 0 for all nodes for facebook subgraph
- which was fixed by calculating and normalizing closeness for each connected component which gave better results.

- python gen_centrality.py networks/smallworld.elist
- python gen_centrality.py subgraphs/facebook.elist
- python gen_centrality.py subgraphs/twitter.elist -> This crashed my laptop
